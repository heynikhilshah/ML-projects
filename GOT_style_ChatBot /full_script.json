It's the last thing you need to hear right now.", "Catelyn Stark: I never knew.", "Cersei Baratheon:  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never.

Be careful you don't cut yourself.", "Arya Stark:  It's so skinny.", "Jon Snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special.

With the great big tits you could bury your face in.", "Eddard Stark:  Bessie. She was one of yours.", "Robert Baratheon: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?", "Eddard Stark:  Wylla.", "Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor.

It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.", "Cersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel?", "Joffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.", "Cersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?", "Joffrey Baratheon:  For me. I'm their King.", "Cersei Baratheon:  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.", "Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not asking.", "Cersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider.

Now what do you want with this?", "Arya Stark:  It's called Needle.", "Eddard Stark:  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister?

You know our words.", "Arya Stark: Winter is coming.", "Eddard Stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.", "Arya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.", "Eddard Stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on.

Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time.

There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.", "Catelyn Stark:  Yours?", "Petyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday.

He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait!\"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.

So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?", "Renly Baratheon: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.", "Loras Tyrell: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.", "Renly Baratheon: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.", "Loras Tyrell: I have an outrageous amount of money.", "Renly Baratheon: Not as much as the Lannisters.", "Loras Tyrell: But a lot more than you.", "Renly Baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King.", "Loras Tyrell: Hmm... How did that ever happen?", "Renly Baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.", "Loras Tyrell: Do you know who should be King?", "Renly Baratheon: Be serious.", "Loras Tyrell: I am.

We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you.", "Loras Tyrell: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing.

We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.

What was she like?", "Robert Baratheon: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?", "Cersei Baratheon: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.", "Robert Baratheon: So why now?", "Cersei Baratheon: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?", "Robert Baratheon: You want to know the horrible truth?

Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind.", "Cersei Baratheon: I felt something for you once, you know?", "Robert Baratheon: I know.", "Cersei Baratheon: Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually.

He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?", "JAIME: First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.", "BRIENNE: If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?", "JAIME: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?
